Email Mike Brody at <a href=\"mailto:brody@houseofcomedy.net\">brody@houseofcomedy.net</a> for spot. Tickets are $5, along with $5 appetizers and select $5 drinks. (There is a service fee with tickets that makes it actually come to $10, but if you get someone on your guest list they get in for free.) WILDCARD SPOTS: If you get to the HoC before 7:15 I will put your name on a list and draw three names. Those three people will get the 1st, 2nd and 3rd spot respectively, after the MC."
